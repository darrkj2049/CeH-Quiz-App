Ethical hacking may be a term meant to imply a broader category\nthan simply penetration testing.

While a white hat hacker hacks under good intentions with permission, and a black\nhat hacker, most frequently unauthorized, has malicious intent, there's a 3rd kind referred to as a\ngray hat hacker who hacks with good intentions but sometimes without permission. White hat\nhackers can also add teams called \"sneakers and/or hacker clubs\",red teams, or tiger teams. While\npenetration testing concentrates on attacking software and computer systems from the beginning -\nscanning ports, examining known defects in protocols and applications running on the system and\npatch installations, as an example - ethical hacking may include other things. A full-blown ethical hack\nmight include emailing staff to invite password details, searching through executive's dustbins and\ntypically breaking and entering, without the knowledge and consent of the targets. Only the owners,\nCEOs and Board Members (stake holders) who asked for such a censoring of this magnitude are\naware. to undertake to duplicate a number of the destructive techniques a true attack might employ,\nethical hackers may arrange for cloned test systems, or organize a hack late in the dark while systems\nare less critical. In most up-to-date cases these hacks perpetuate for the long-term con (days, if not\nweeks, of long-term human infiltration into an organization). Some examples include leaving\nUSB/flash key drives with hidden auto-start software during a public area as if someone lost the tiny\ndrive and an unsuspecting employee found it and took it. Some other methods of completing these\ninclude: * DoS attacks * Social engineering tactics * Reverse engineering * Network security * Disk\nand memory forensics * Vulnerability research * Security scanners such as: - W3af - Nessus - Burp sui\nte * Frameworks such as: - Metasploit * Training Platforms These methods identify and exploit known\nsecurity vulnerabilities and plan to evade security to realize entry into secured areas. they're ready to\ndo that by hiding software and system 'back-doors' which will be used as a link to information or\naccess that a non-ethical hacker, also referred to as 'black-hat' or 'grey-hat', might want to succeed in\n.IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n8"

    "explanation": "Twofish is an encryption algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier. It's a symmetric key block cipher with\na block size of 128 bits, with keys up to 256 bits. it's associated with AES (Advanced Encryption\nStandard) and an earlier block cipher called Blowfish. Twofish was actually a finalist to become the\nindustry standard for encryption, but was ultimately beaten out by the present AES. Twofish hasIT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n13\n\nsome distinctive features that set it aside from most other cryptographic protocols. For one, it uses\npre-computed, key-dependent S-boxes. An S-box (substitution-box) may be a basic component of any\nsymmetric key algorithm which performs substitution. within the context of Twofish's block cipher,\nthe S-box works to obscure the connection of the key to the ciphertext. Twofish uses a pre-\ncomputed, key-dependent S-box which suggests that the S-box is already provided, but depends on\nthe cipher key to decrypt the knowledge .\nHow Secure is Twofish?\nTwofish is seen as a really secure option as far as encryption protocols go. one among the\nexplanations that it wasn't selected because the advanced encryption standard is thanks to its slower\nspeed. Any encryption standard that uses a 128-bit or higher key, is theoretically safe from brute\nforce attacks. Twofish is during this category. Because Twofish uses \"pre-computed key-dependent S-\nboxes\", it are often susceptible to side channel attacks. this is often thanks to the tables being pre-\ncomputed. However, making these tables key-dependent helps mitigate that risk. There are a couple\nof attacks on Twofish, but consistent with its creator, Bruce Schneier, it didn't constitute a real\ncryptanalysis. These attacks didn't constitue a practical break within the cipher.\nProducts That Use Twofish\nGnuPG: GnuPG may be a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by\nRFC4880 (also referred to as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and\ncommunications; it features a flexible key management system, along side access modules for all\ntypes of public key directories. KeePass: KeePass may be a password management tool that\ngenerates passwords with top-notch security. It's a free, open source, lightweight and easy-to-use\npassword manager with many extensions and plugins. Password Safe: Password Safe uses one master\npassword to stay all of your passwords protected, almost like the functionality of most of the\npassword managers on this list. It allows you to store all of your passwords during a single password\ndatabase, or multiple databases for various purposes. Creating a database is straightforward , just\ncreate the database, set your master password. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): PGP is employed mostly\nfor email encryption, it encrypts the content of the e-mail . However, Pretty Good Privacy doesn't\nencrypt the topic and sender of the e-mail , so make certain to never put sensitive information in\nthese fields when using PGP. TrueCrypt: TrueCrypt may be a software program that encrypts and\nprotects files on your devices. With TrueCrypt the encryption is transparent to the user and is\ncompleted locally at the user's computer. this suggests you'll store a TrueCrypt file on a server and\nTrueCrypt will encrypt that file before it's sent over the network."

Given these\nfacts, it's really no surprise that telnet is usually seen on the highest Ten Target Ports list. Several of\nthe vulnerabilities of telnet are fixed. They require only an upgrade to the foremost current version of\nthe telnet Daemon or OS upgrade. As is usually the case, this upgrade has not been performed on\nvariety of devices. this might flow from to the very fact that a lot of systems administrators and users\ndon't fully understand the risks involved using telnet. Unfortunately, the sole solution for a few of\ntelnets vulnerabilities is to completely discontinue its use. the well-liked method of mitigating all of\ntelnets vulnerabilities is replacing it with alternate protocols like ssh. Ssh is capable of providing many\nof an equivalent functions as telnet and a number of other additional services typical handled by\nother protocols like FTP and Xwindows. Ssh does still have several drawbacks to beat before it can\ncompletely replace telnet. it's typically only supported on newer equipment. It requires processor\nand memory resources to perform the info encryption and decryption. It also requires greater\nbandwidth than telnet thanks to the encryption of the info . This paper was written to assist clarify\nhow dangerous the utilization of telnet are often and to supply solutions to alleviate the main known\nthreats so as to enhance the general security of the web Once a reputation is resolved to an IP\ncaching also helps: the resolved name-to-IP is usually cached on the local system (and possibly on\nintermediate DNS servers) for a period of your time .

Of course, once\nthe IP address of the remote service is understood , applications can use that information to enable\nother TCP-based protocols, like HTTP, to try to to their actual work, for instance ensuring internet cat\nGIFs are often reliably shared together with your colleagues.

    "explanation": "One of the most common Nmap usage scenarios is scanning an Ethernet LAN. Most LANs, especially\nthose that use the private address range granted by RFC 1918, do not always use the overwhelming\nmajority of IP addresses. When Nmap attempts to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo\nrequest, the OS must determine a destination hardware (ARP) address, such as the target IP, so that\nthe Ethernet frame can be properly addressed. .. This is required to issue a series of ARP requests.\nThis is best illustrated by an example where a ping scan is attempted against an Area Ethernet host.\nThe -send-ip option tells Nmap to send IP-level packets (rather than raw Ethernet), even on area\nnetworks. The Wireshark output of the three ARP requests and their timing have been pasted into\nthe session.\nRaw IP ping scan example for offline targets\nThis example took quite a couple of seconds to finish because the (Linux) OS sent three ARP requests\nat 1 second intervals before abandoning the host. Waiting for a few seconds is excessive, as long as\nthe ARP response usually arrives within a few milliseconds. Reducing this timeout period is not a\npriority for OS vendors, as the overwhelming majority of packets are sent to the host that actually\nexists. Nmap, on the other hand, needs to send packets to 16 million IP s given a target like\n10.0.0.0/8. Many targets are pinged in parallel, but waiting 2 seconds each is very delayed.IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n18\n\nThere is another problem with raw IP ping scans on the LAN. If the destination host turns out to be\nunresponsive, as in the previous example, the source host usually adds an incomplete entry for that\ndestination IP to the kernel ARP table. ARP tablespaces are finite and some operating systems\nbecome unresponsive when full. If Nmap is used in rawIP mode (-send-ip), Nmap may have to wait a\nfew minutes for the ARP cache entry to expire before continuing host discovery.\nARP scans solve both problems by giving Nmap the highest priority. Nmap issues raw ARP requests\nand handles retransmissions and timeout periods in its sole discretion. The system ARP cache is\nbypassed. The example shows the difference. This ARP scan takes just over a tenth of the time it\ntakes for an equivalent IP.\nExample b ARP ping scan of offline target\n \nIn example b, neither the -PR option nor the -send-eth option has any effect. This is often because\nARP has a default scan type on the Area Ethernet network when scanning Ethernet hosts that Nmap\ndiscovers. This includes traditional wired Ethernet as 802.11 wireless networks. As mentioned above,\nARP scanning is not only more efficient, but also more accurate. Hosts frequently block IP-based ping\npackets, but usually cannot block ARP requests or responses and communicate over the\nnetwork.Nmap uses ARP instead of all targets on equivalent targets, even if different ping types (such\nas -PE and -PS) are specified. LAN.. If you do not need to attempt an ARP scan at all, specify -send-ip\nas shown in Example a \"Raw IP Ping Scan for Offline Targets\".\nIf you give Nmap control to send raw Ethernet frames, Nmap can also adjust the source MAC\naddress. If you have the only PowerBook in your security conference room and a large ARP scan is\ninitiated from an Apple-registered MAC address, your head may turn to you. Use the -spoof-mac\noption to spoof the MAC address as described in the MAC Address Spoofing section."

The target system interacts with the \"zombie\" pc and distinction in behavior are\noften discovered mistreatment totally different|completely different \"zombies\" with proof of various\nprivileges granted by the target to different computers.\nThe overall intention behind the idle scan is to \"check the port standing whereas remaining utterly\ninvisible to the targeted host.\" The first step in execution associate idle scan is to seek out associate\napplicable zombie. It must assign informatics ID packets incrementally on a worldwide (rather than\nper-host it communicates with) basis. It ought to be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic\ncan raise its informatics ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the\noffender and also the zombie, and between the zombie and also the target, the quicker the scan can\nproceed.\nNote that once a port is open, IPIDs increment by a pair of. Following is that the sequence:\noffender to focus on -> SYN, target to zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to focus on -> RST (IPID increment\nby 1) currently offender tries to probe zombie for result. offender to Zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to\noffender -> RST (IPID increment by 1) So, during this method IPID increments by a pair of finally.\nWhen associate idle scan is tried, tools (for example nmap) tests the projected zombie and reports\nany issues with it. If one does not work, attempt another. Enough net hosts square measure\nvulnerable that zombie candidates are not exhausting to seek out. a standard approach is to easily\nexecute a ping sweep of some network. selecting a network close to your supply address, or close to\nthe target, produces higher results. you'll be able to attempt associate idle scan mistreatment every\nobtainable host from the ping sweep results till you discover one that works. As usual, it's best to\nraise permission before mistreatment someone's machines for surprising functions like idle scanning.\nSimple network devices typically create nice zombies as a result of {they square measure|they're}\nnormally each underused (idle) and designed with straightforward network stacks that are\nsusceptible to informatics ID traffic detection.\nWhile distinguishing an acceptable zombie takes some initial work, you'll be able to keep re-using the\nnice ones. as an alternative, there are some analysis on utilizing unplanned public internet services as\nzombie hosts to perform similar idle scans. leverage the approach a number of these services\nperform departing connections upon user submissions will function some quite poor's man idle\nscanning."

These buffers typically sleep in RAM\nmemory. Computers frequently use buffers to assist improve performance; latest hard drives cash in\nof buffering to efficiently access data, and lots of online services also use buffers. for instance ,\nbuffers are frequently utilized in online video streaming to stop interruption.

Buffer overflows are often exploited by attackers to corrupt\nsoftware. Despite being well-understood, buffer overflow attacks are still a serious security problem\nthat torment cyber-security teams. In 2014 a threat referred to as 'heartbleed' exposed many many\nusers to attack due to a buffer overflow vulnerability in SSL software.\nHow do attackers exploit buffer overflows?\nAn attacker can deliberately feed a carefully crafted input into a program which will cause the\nprogram to undertake and store that input during a buffer that isn't large enough, overwriting\nportions of memory connected to the buffer space. If the memory layout of the program is well-\ndefined, the attacker can deliberately overwrite areas known to contain executable code. The\nattacker can then replace this code together with his own executable code, which may drastically\nchange how the program is meant to figure . For example if the overwritten part in memory contains\na pointer (an object that points to a different place in memory) the attacker's code could replace that\ncode with another pointer that points to an exploit payload. this will transfer control of the entire\nprogram over to the attacker's code."

A wired local area\nnetwork (LAN) is usually protected by physical security mechanisms (controlled access to a building,\nfor example) that are effective for a controlled physical environment, but could also be ineffective for\nWLANs because radio waves aren't necessarily bound by the walls containing the network. WEP\nseeks to determine similar protection thereto offered by the wired network's physical security\nmeasures by encrypting data transmitted over the WLAN. encoding protects the vulnerable wireless\nlink between clients and access points; once this measure has been taken, other typical LAN security\nmechanisms like password protection, end-to-end encryption, virtual private networks (VPNs), and\nauthentication are often put in situ to make sure privacy. A research group from the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley recently published a report citing \"major security flaws\" in WEP that left WLANs\nusing the protocol susceptible to attacks (called wireless equivalent privacy attacks). within the\ncourse of the group's examination of the technology, they were ready to intercept and modify\ntransmissions and gain access to restricted networks. The Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance\n(WECA) claims that WEP - which is included in many networking products - was never intended to b\ne the only security mechanism for a WLAN, and that, in conjunction with traditional security\npractices, it's very effective."

They can be quite confusing and complicated\nto set up the first time you go through the process, but when you understand what is going on,\neverything should make more sense.\nSNMP has gone through several revisions to improve performance and security (version 1, 2c and 3).\nBy default, it is a UDP port based protocol where communication is based on a 'fire and forget'\nmethodology in which network packets are sent to another device, but there is no check for receipt\nof that packet (versus TCP port when a network packet must be acknowledged by the other end of\nthe communication link).\nThere are two modes of operation with SNMP - get requests (or polling) where one device requests\ninformation from an SNMP enabled device on a regular basis (normally using UDP port 161), and\ntraps where the SNMP enabled device sends a message to another device when an event occurs\n(normally using UDP port 162). The latter includes instances such as someone logging on, the device\npowering up or down, or a wide variety of other problems that would need this type of investigation.\nThis blog covers SNMPv3 traps, as polling and version 2c traps are covered elsewhere in our\ndocumentation.\nSNMP traps\nSince SNMP is primarily a UDP port based system, traps may be 'lost' when sending between devices;\nthe sending device does not wait to see if the receiver got the trap. This means if the configuration on\nthe sending device is wrong (using the wrong receiver IP address or port) or the receiver isn't\nlistening for traps or rejecting them out of hand due to misconfiguration, the sender will never know.\nThe SNMP v2c specification introduced the idea of splitting traps into two types; the original 'hope it\ngets there' trap and the newer 'INFORM' traps. Upon receipt of an INFORM, the receiver must send\nan acknowledgement back. If the sender doesn't get the acknowledgement back, then it knows there\nis an existing problem and can log it for sysadmins to find when they interrogate the device."

    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "DNS tunneling may be a method wont to send data over the DNS protocol, a protocol which has\nnever been intended for data transfer. due to that, people tend to overlook it and it's become a well-\nliked but effective tool in many attacks. Most popular use case for DNS tunneling is obtaining free\ninternet through bypassing captive portals at airports, hotels, or if you are feeling patient the not-so-\ncheap on the wing Wi-Fi. On those shared internet hotspots HTTP traffic is blocked until a\nusername/password is provided, however DNS traffic is usually still allowed within the background:\nwe will encode our HTTP traffic over DNS and void, we've internet access. This sounds fun but reality\nis, browsing anything on DNS tunneling is slow. Like, back to 1998 slow. Another more dangerous use\nof DNS tunneling would be bypassing network security devices (Firewalls, DLP appliances...) to line up\nan immediate and unmonitored communications channel on an organisation's network. Possibilities\nhere are endless: Data exfiltration, fixing another penetration testing tool... you name it. To make it\neven more worrying, there's an outsized amount of easy to use DNS tunneling tools out there.\nThere's even a minimum of one VPN over DNS protocol provider (warning: the planning of the web\nsite is hideous, making me doubt on the legitimacy of it). As a pentester all this is often great, as a\nnetwork admin not such a lot .\nHow does it work:\nFor those that ignoramus about DNS protocol but still made it here, i feel you deserve a really brief\nexplanation on what DNS does: DNS is sort of a phonebook for the web , it translates URLs (human-\nfriendly language, the person's name), into an IP address (machine-friendly language, the phone\nnumber). That helps us remember many websites, same as we will remember many people's names.\nFor those that know what DNS is i might suggest looking here for a fast refresh on DNS protocol, but\nbriefly what you would like to understand is: * A Record: Maps a website name to an IP address.\nexample.com ? 12.34.52.67 * NS Record (a.k.a. Nameserver record): Maps a website name to an\ninventory of DNS servers, just in case our website is hosted in multiple servers. example.com ?\nserver1.example.com, server2.example.com Who is involved in DNS tunneling? * Client. Will launch\nDNS requests with data in them to a website . * One Domain that we will configure. So DNS servers\nwill redirect its requests to an outlined server of our own. * Server. this is often the defined\nnameserver which can ultimately receive the DNS requests. The 6 Steps in DNS tunneling (simplified):\n1. The client encodes data during a DNS request. The way it does this is often by prepending a bit of\nknowledge within the domain of the request. for instance : mypieceofdata.server1.example.com 2.\nThe DNS request goes bent a DNS server. 3. The DNS server finds out the A register of your domain\nwith the IP address of your server. 4. The request for mypieceofdata.server1.example.com is\nforwarded to the server. 5. The server processes regardless of the mypieceofdata was alleged to do.\nLet's assume it had been an HTTP request. 6. The server replies back over DNS and woop woop,\nwe've got signal."

A switch is elected as root\nbased on the lowest configured priority of any switch (0 through 65,535). When a switch boots up, it\nbegins a process of identifying other switches and determining the root bridge. After a root bridge is\nelected, the topology is established from its perspective of the connectivity. The switches determine\nthe path to the root bridge, and all redundant paths are blocked. STP sends configuration and\ntopology change notifications and acknowledgments (TCN/TCA) using bridge protocol data units\n(BPDU).\nAn STP attack involves an attacker spoofing the root bridge in the topology. The attacker broadcasts\nout an STP configuration/topology change BPDU in an attempt to force an STP recalculation. The\nBPDU sent out announces that the attacker's system has a lower bridge priority. The attacker can\nthen see a variety of frames forwarded from other switches to it. STP recalculation may also cause a\ndenial-of-service (DoS) condition on the network by causing an interruption of 30 to 45 seconds each\ntime the root bridge changes.

This list will then be targeted with spear phishing to do\nand gather credentials. an easy technique may include an email that says your bill has spiked 500th\nwithin the past 24 hours, \"click here for additional information\", and when they click the link, they're\nforwarded to a malicious copy of the AWS login page designed to steal their credentials.\nAn example of such an email will be seen within the screenshot below. it's exactly like an email that\nAWS would send to you if you were to exceed the free tier limits, except for a few little changes. If\nyou clicked on any of the highlighted regions within the screenshot, you'd not be taken to the official\nAWS web site and you'd instead be forwarded to a pretend login page setup to steal your credentials.\nThese emails will get even more specific by playing a touch bit additional OSINT before causing them\nout. If an attacker was ready to discover your AWS account ID on-line somewhere, they could use\nmethods we at rhino have free previously to enumerate what users and roles exist in your account\nwith none logs contact on your side. they could use this list to more refine their target list, further as\ntheir emails to reference services they will know that you often use.IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n61\n\nFor reference, the journal post for using AWS account IDs for role enumeration will be found here\nand the journal post for using AWS account IDs for user enumeration will be found here.\nDuring engagements at rhino, we find that phishing is one in all the fastest ways for us to achieve\naccess to an AWS environment."

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The purpose of this idea is to permit multiple customers to figure on joint projects and applications\nthat belong to the community, where it's necessary to possess a centralized clouds infrastructure. In\nother words, Community Cloud may be a distributed infrastructure that solves the precise problems\nwith business sectors by integrating the services provided by differing types of clouds solutions.\nThe communities involved in these projects, like tenders, business organizations, and research\ncompanies, specialise in similar issues in their cloud interactions. Their shared interests may include\nconcepts and policies associated with security and compliance considerations, and therefore the\ngoals of the project also .\nCommunity Cloud computing facilitates its users to spot and analyze their business demands better.\nCommunity Clouds could also be hosted during a data center, owned by one among the tenants, or\nby a third-party cloud services provider and may be either on-site or off-site.\nCommunity Cloud Examples and Use Cases\nCloud providers have developed Community Cloud offerings, and a few organizations are already\nseeing the advantages . the subsequent list shows a number of the most scenarios of the Community\nCloud model that's beneficial to the participating organizations.\nMultiple governmental departments that perform transactions with each other can have their\nprocessing systems on shared infrastructure. This setup makes it cost-effective to the tenants, and\nmay also reduce their data traffic.\nBenefits of Community Clouds\nCommunity Cloud provides benefits to organizations within the community, individually also as\ncollectively. Organizations don't need to worry about the safety concerns linked with Public Cloud\ndue to the closed user group.\nThis recent cloud computing model has great potential for businesses seeking cost-effective cloud\nservices to collaborate on joint projects, because it comes with multiple advantages.\nOpenness and Impartiality\nCommunity Clouds are open systems, and that they remove the dependency organizations wear\ncloud service providers. Organizations are able to do many benefits while avoiding the disadvantages\nof both public and personal clouds.IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n71\n\nFlexibility and Scalability\nEnsures compatibility among each of its users, allowing them to switch properties consistent with\ntheir individual use cases. They also enable companies to interact with their remote employees and\nsupport the utilization of various devices, be it a smartphone or a tablet. This makes this sort of cloud\nsolution more flexible to users' demands.\nConsists of a community of users and, as such, is scalable in several aspects like hardware resources,\nservices, and manpower. It takes under consideration demand growth, and you simply need to\nincrease the user-base.\nHigh Availability and Reliability\nYour cloud service must be ready to make sure the availability of knowledge and applications in the\nleast times. Community Clouds secure your data within the same way as the other cloud service, by\nreplicating data and applications in multiple secure locations to guard them from unforeseen\ncircumstances.\nCloud possesses redundant infrastructure to form sure data is out there whenever and wherever you\nwould like it. High availability and reliability are critical concerns for any sort of cloud solution.\nSecurity and Compliance\nTwo significant concerns discussed when organizations believe cloud computing are data security and\ncompliance with relevant regulatory authorities. Compromising each other's data security isn't\nprofitable to anyone during a Community Cloud.\nUsers can configure various levels of security for his or her data. Common use cases:\nthe power to dam users from editing and downloading specific datasets.\nMaking sensitive data subject to strict regulations on who has access to Sharing sensitive data unique\nto a specific organization would bring harm to all or any the members involved.\nWhat devices can store sensitive data.\nConvenience and Control\nConflicts associated with convenience and control don't arise during a Community Cloud. Democracy\nmay be a crucial factor the Community Cloud offers as all tenants share and own the infrastructure\nand make decisions collaboratively. This setup allows organizations to possess their data closer to\nthem while avoiding the complexities of a personal Cloud.\nLess Work for the IT Department\nHaving data, applications, and systems within the cloud means you are doing not need to manage\nthem entirely. This convenience eliminates the necessity for tenants to use extra human resources to\nmanage the system. Even during a self-managed solution, the work is split among the participating\norganizations.\nEnvironment Sustainability\nIn the Community Cloud, organizations use one platform for all their needs, which dissuades them\nfrom investing in separate cloud facilities. This shift introduces a symbiotic relationship between\nbroadening and shrinking the utilization of cloud among clients. With the reduction of organizations\nusing different clouds, resources are used more efficiently, thus resulting in a smaller carbon\nfootprint."

    "explanation": "Appropriately controlling admittance to web content is significant for running a safe web worker.\nIndex crossing or Path Traversal is a HTTP assault which permits aggressors to get to limited catalogs\nand execute orders outside of the web worker's root registry.\nWeb workers give two primary degrees of security instruments\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs)\nRoot index\nAn Access Control List is utilized in the approval cycle. It is a rundown which the web worker's\nmanager uses to show which clients or gatherings can get to, change or execute specific records on\nthe worker, just as other access rights.\nThe root registry is a particular index on the worker record framework in which the clients are kept.\nClients can't get to anything over this root.\nFor instance: the default root registry of IIS on Windows is C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot and with this\narrangement, a client doesn't approach C:\\Windows yet approaches C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\news and\nsome other indexes and documents under the root catalog (given that the client is confirmed by\nmeans of the ACLs).\nThe root index keeps clients from getting to any documents on the worker, for example,\nC:\\WINDOWS/system32/win.ini on Windows stages and the/and so on/passwd record on Linux/UNIX\nstages.\nThis weakness can exist either in the web worker programming itself or in the web application code.\nTo play out a registry crossing assault, all an assailant requires is an internet browser and some\ninformation on where to aimlessly discover any default documents and registries on the framework.\nWhat an assailant can do if your site is defenselessIT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n84\n\nWith a framework defenseless against index crossing, an aggressor can utilize this weakness to\nventure out of the root catalog and access different pieces of the record framework. This may enable\nthe assailant to see confined documents, which could give the aggressor more data needed to\nadditional trade off the framework.\nContingent upon how the site access is set up, the aggressor will execute orders by mimicking himself\nas the client which is related with \"the site\". Along these lines everything relies upon what the site\nclient has been offered admittance to in the framework.\nIllustration of a Directory Traversal assault by means of web application code In web applications\nwith dynamic pages, input is generally gotten from programs through GET or POST solicitation\ntechniques. Here is an illustration of a HTTP GET demand URL GET\nhttp://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=oldarchive.html HTTP/1.1 Host: test.webarticles.com\nWith this URL, the browser requests the dynamic page show.asp from the server and with it also\nsends the parameter view with the value of oldarchive.html. When this request is executed on the\nweb server, show.asp retrieves the file oldarchive.html from the server's file system, renders it and\nthen sends it back to the browser which displays it to the user. The attacker would assume that\nshow.asp can retrieve files from the file system and sends the following custom URL.\nGET http://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=../../../../../Windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1 Host:\ntest.webarticles.com This will cause the dynamic page to retrieve the file system.ini from the file\nsystem and display it to the user. The expression ../ instructs the system to go one directory up which\nis commonly used as an operating system directive. The attacker has to guess how many directories\nhe has to go up to find the Windows folder on the system, but this is easily done by trial and error.\nExample of a Directory Traversal attack via web server\nApart from vulnerabilities in the code, even the web server itself can be open to directory traversal\nattacks. The problem can either be incorporated into the web server software or inside some sample\nscript files left available on the server.\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in the latest versions of web server software, but there are web\nservers online which are still using older versions of IIS and Apache which might be open to directory\ntraversal attacks. Even though you might be using a web server software version that has fixed this\nvulnerability, you might still have some sensitive default script directories exposed which are well\nknown to hackers.\nFor example, a URL request which makes use of the scripts directory of IIS to traverse directories and\nexecute a command can be GET\nhttp://server.com/scripts/..%5c../Windows/System32/cmd.exe?/c+dir+c:\\ HTTP/1.1 Host: server.com\nThe request would return to the user a list of all files in the C:\\ directory by executing the cmd.exe\ncommand shell file and run the command dir c:\\ in the shell. The %5c expression that is in the URL\nrequest is a web server escape code which is used to represent normal characters. In this case %5c\nrepresents the character \\.\nNewer versions of modern web server software check for these escape codes and do not let them\nthrough. Some older versions however, do not filter out these codes in the root directory enforcer\nand will let the attackers execute such commands."

Due the straightforward yet elegant nature of this attack, it\nrequires minimal bandwidth to implement and affects the target server's web server only, with\nalmost no side effects on other services and ports. Slowloris has proven highly-effective against many\npopular sorts of web server software, including Apache 1.x and 2.x. Over the years, Slowloris has\nbeen credited with variety of high-profile server takedowns. Notably, it had been used extensively by\nIranian 'hackivists' following the 2009 Iranian presidential election to attack Iranian government\ninternet sites . Slowloris works by opening multiple connections to the targeted web server and\nkeeping them open as long as possible. It does this by continuously sending partial HTTP requests,IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n88\n\nnone of which are ever completed. The attacked servers open more and connections open, expecting\neach of the attack requests to be completed. Periodically, the Slowloris sends subsequent HTTP\nheaders for every request, but never actually completes the request. Ultimately, the targeted server's\nmaximum concurrent connection pool is filled, and extra (legitimate) connection attempts are\ndenied. By sending partial, as against malformed, packets, Slowloris can easily elapse traditional\nIntrusion Detection systems. Named after a kind of slow-moving Asian primate, Slowloris really does\nwin the race by moving slowly and steadily. A Slowloris attack must await sockets to be released by\nlegitimate requests before consuming them one by one. For a high-volume internet site , this will\ntake a while . the method are often further slowed if legitimate sessions are reinitiated. But within\nthe end, if the attack is unmitigated, Slowloris-like the tortoise-wins the race. If undetected or\nunmitigated, Slowloris attacks also can last for long periods of your time . When attacked sockets\nouting , Slowloris simply reinitiates the connections, continuing to reach the online server until\nmitigated. Designed for stealth also as efficacy, Slowloris are often modified to send different host\nheaders within the event that a virtual host is targeted, and logs are stored separately for every\nvirtual host. More importantly, within the course of an attack, Slowloris are often set to suppress log\nfile creation. this suggests the attack can catch unmonitored servers off-guard, with none red flags\nappearing in log file entries. Methods of mitigation Imperva's security services are enabled by reverse\nproxy technology, used for inspection of all incoming requests on their thanks to the clients' servers.\nImperva's secured proxy won't forward any partial connection requests-rendering all Slowloris DDoS\nattack attempts completely and utterly useless."

    "explanation": "A DHCP starvation assault is a pernicious computerized assault that objectives DHCP workers. During\na DHCP assault, an unfriendly entertainer floods a DHCP worker with false DISCOVER bundles until\nthe DHCP worker debilitates its stock of IP addresses. When that occurs, the aggressor can deny\ngenuine organization clients administration, or even stock an other DHCP association that prompts a\nMan-in-the-Middle (MITM) assault.\nIn a DHCP Starvation assault, a threatening entertainer sends a huge load of false DISCOVER parcels\nuntil the DHCP worker thinks they've used their accessible pool. Customers searching for IP tends to\nfind that there are no IP addresses for them, and they're refused assistance. Furthermore, they may\nsearch for an alternate DHCP worker, one which the unfriendly entertainer may give. What's more,\nutilizing a threatening or sham IP address, that unfriendly entertainer would now be able to peruse\nall the traffic that customer sends and gets.\nIn an unfriendly climate, where we have a malevolent machine running some sort of an instrument\nlike Yersinia, there could be a machine that sends DHCP DISCOVER bundles. This malevolent\ncustomer doesn't send a modest bunch - it sends a great many vindictive DISCOVER bundles utilizing\nsham, made-up MAC addresses as the source MAC address for each solicitation.\nIn the event that the DHCP worker reacts to every one of these false DHCP DISCOVER parcels, the\nwhole IP address pool could be exhausted, and that DHCP worker could trust it has no more IP\ndelivers to bring to the table to legitimate DHCP demands.\nWhen a DHCP worker has no more IP delivers to bring to the table, ordinarily the following thing to\nhappen would be for the aggressor to get their own DHCP worker. This maverick DHCP worker at that\npoint starts giving out IP addresses.\nThe advantage of that to the assailant is that if a false DHCP worker is distributing IP addresses,\nincluding default DNS and door data, customers who utilize those IP delivers and begin to utilize that\ndefault passage would now be able to be directed through the aggressor's machine. That is all that an\nunfriendly entertainer requires to play out a man-in-the-center (MITM) assault."

    "explanation": "Clickjacking is an attack that tricks a user into clicking a webpage element which is invisible or\ndisguised as another element. this will cause users to unwittingly download malware, visit malicious\nsites , provide credentials or sensitive information, transfer money, or purchase products online.\nTypically, clickjacking is performed by displaying an invisible page or HTML element, inside an iframe,\non top of the page the user sees. The user believes they're clicking the visible page but actually\nthey're clicking an invisible element within the additional page transposed on top of it. The invisible\npage might be a malicious page, or a legitimate page the user didn't shall visit - for instance , a page\non the user's banking site that authorizes the transfer of cash . There are several variations of the\nclickjacking attack, such as: * Likejacking - a way during which the Facebook \"Like\" button is\nmanipulated, causing users to \"like\" a page they really didn't shall like. * Cursorjacking - a UI\nredressing technique that changes the cursor for the position the user perceives to a different\nposition. Cursorjacking relies on vulnerabilities in Flash and therefore the Firefox browser, which have\nnow been fixed.\nClickjacking attack example\n1. The attacker creates a beautiful page which promises to offer the user a free trip to Tahiti. 2.\nwithin the background the attacker checks if the user is logged into his banking site and if so, loads\nthe screen that permits transfer of funds, using query parameters to insert the attacker's bank details\ninto the shape . 3. The bank transfer page is displayed in an invisible iframe above the free gift page,\nwith the \"Confirm Transfer\" button exactly aligned over the \"Receive Gift\" button visible to the user.\n4. The user visits the page and clicks the \"Book My Free Trip\" button. 5. actually the user is clicking on\nthe invisible iframe, and has clicked the \"Confirm Transfer\" button. Funds are transferred to the\nattacker. 6. The user is redirected to a page with information about the free gift (not knowing what\nhappened within the background).\nThis example illustrates that, during a clickjacking attack, the malicious action (on the bank website,\nduring this case) can't be traced back to the attacker because the user performed it while being\nlegitimately signed into their own account.\nClickjacking mitigation\nThere are two general ways to defend against clickjacking: * Client-side methods - the foremost\ncommon is named Frame Busting. Client-side methods are often effective in some cases, but are\nconsidered to not be a best practice, because they will be easily bypassed. * Server-side methods - the\nforemost common is X-Frame-Options. Server-side methods are recommended by security experts as\nan efficient thanks to defend against clickjacking."

These protocols allow everyone on the net\nto browse the net, use email, look on-line, and send instant messages while not third-parties being\nable to browse the communication.\nDROWN allows attackers to break the encryption and read or steal sensitive communications, as well\nas passwords, credit card numbers, trade secrets, or financial data. At the time of public disclosure on\nMarch 2016, our measurements indicated thirty third of all HTTPS servers were vulnerable to the\nattack. fortuitously, the vulnerability is much less prevalent currently. As of 2019, SSL Labs estimates\nthat one.2% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable.\nWhat will the attackers gain?\nAny communication between users and the server. This typically includes, however isn't limited to,\nusernames and passwords, credit card numbers, emails, instant messages, and sensitive documents.\nunder some common scenarios, an attacker can also impersonate a secure web site and intercept or\nchange the content the user sees.\nWho is vulnerable?\nWebsites, mail servers, and other TLS-dependent services are in danger for the DROWN attack. At the\ntime of public disclosure, many popular sites were affected. we used Internet-wide scanning to live\nhow many sites are vulnerable:IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n96\n\n \nOperators of vulnerable servers got to take action. there's nothing practical that browsers or end-\nusers will do on their own to protect against this attack.\nIs my site vulnerable?\nModern servers and shoppers use the TLS encryption protocol. However, because of\nmisconfigurations, several servers also still support SSLv2, a 1990s-era precursor to TLS. This support\ndid not matter in practice, since no up-to-date clients really use SSLv2. Therefore, despite the fact\nthat SSLv2 is thought to be badly insecure, until now, simply supporting SSLv2 wasn't thought of a\nsecurity problem, is a clients never used it.\nDROWN shows that merely supporting SSLv2 may be a threat to fashionable servers and clients. It\nmodern associate degree attacker to modern fashionable TLS connections between up-to-date\nclients and servers by sending probes to a server that supports SSLv2 and uses the same private key.\n \nA server is vulnerable to DROWN if:\nIt allows SSLv2 connections. This is surprisingly common, due to misconfiguration and inappropriate\ndefault settings.\nIts private key is used on any other serverthat allows SSLv2 connections, even for another protocol.\nMany companies reuse the same certificate and key on their web and email servers, for instance. In\nthis case, if the email server supports SSLv2 and the web server does not, an attacker can take\nadvantage of the email server to break TLS connections to the web server.\n \nHow do I protect my server?IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n97\n\nTo protect against DROWN, server operators need to ensure that their private keys software used\nanyplace with server computer code that enables SSLv2 connections. This includes net servers, SMTP\nservers, IMAP and POP servers, and the other software that supports SSL/TLS.\nDisabling SSLv2 is difficult and depends on the particular server software. we offer instructions here\nfor many common products:\nOpenSSL: OpenSSL may be a science library employed in several server merchandise. For users of\nOpenSSL, the simplest and recommended solution is to upgrade to a recent OpenSSL version.\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users ought to upgrade to 1.0.2g. OpenSSL 1.0.1 users ought to upgrade to one.0.1s.\nUsers of older OpenSSL versions ought to upgrade to either one in every of these versions. (Updated\nMarch thirteenth, 16:00 UTC) Microsoft IIS (Windows Server): Support for SSLv2 on the server aspect\nis enabled by default only on the OS versions that correspond to IIS 7.0 and IIS seven.5, particularly\nWindows scene, Windows Server 2008, Windows seven and Windows Server 2008R2. This support is\ndisabled within the appropriate SSLv2 subkey for 'Server', as outlined in KB245030. albeit users\nhaven't taken the steps to disable SSLv2, the export-grade and 56-bit ciphers that build DROWN\npossible don't seem to be supported by default.\nNetwork Security Services (NSS): NSS may be a common science library designed into several server\nmerchandise. NSS versions three.13 (released back in 2012) and higher than ought to have SSLv2\ndisabled by default. (A little variety of users might have enabled SSLv2 manually and can got to take\nsteps to disable it.) Users of older versions ought to upgrade to a more moderen version. we tend to\nstill advocate checking whether or not your non-public secret is exposed elsewhere Other affected\nsoftware and in operation systems:\nInstructions and data for: Apache, Postfix, Nginx, Debian, Red Hat\nBrowsers and other consumers: practical nothing practical that net browsers or different client\ncomputer code will do to stop DROWN. only server operators ar ready to take action to guard against\nthe attack."

In Stealth, you merely type within the entire 192-bit (24 character) key instead of entering\neach of the three keys individually. The Triple DES DLL then breaks the user-provided key into three\nsubkeys, padding the keys if necessary in order that they are each 64 bits long. The procedure for\nencryption is strictly an equivalent as regular DES, but it's repeated 3 times , hence the name Triple\nDES. the info is encrypted with the primary key, decrypted with the second key, and eventually\nencrypted again with the third key. Triple DES runs 3 times slower than DES, but is far safer if used\nproperly. The procedure for decrypting something is that the same because the procedure forIT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n111\n\nencryption, except it's executed in reverse. Like DES, data is encrypted and decrypted in 64-bit\nchunks. Although the input key for DES is 64 bits long, the particular key employed by DES is merely\n56 bits long . the smallest amount significant (right-most) bit in each byte may be a parity , and will be\nset in order that there are always an odd number of 1s in every byte. These parity bits are ignored, so\nonly the seven most vital bits of every byte are used, leading to a key length of 56 bits. this suggests\nthat the effective key strength for Triple DES is really 168 bits because each of the three keys contains\n8 parity bits that aren't used during the encryption process. Triple DES Modes Triple ECB (Electronic\nCode Book) * This variant of Triple DES works precisely the same way because the ECB mode of DES.\n* this is often the foremost commonly used mode of operation. Triple CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) *\nThis method is extremely almost like the quality DES CBC mode. * like Triple ECB, the effective key\nlength is 168 bits and keys are utilized in an equivalent manner, as described above, but the chaining\nfeatures of CBC mode also are employed. * the primary 64-bit key acts because the Initialization\nVector to DES. * Triple ECB is then executed for one 64-bit block of plaintext. * The resulting\nciphertext is then XORed with subsequent plaintext block to be encrypted, and therefore the\nprocedure is repeated. * This method adds an additional layer of security to Triple DES and is\ntherefore safer than Triple ECB, although it's not used as widely as Triple ECB."

      "C": "Evil twin",
      "D": "Wardriving"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "In this attack KRACK is an acronym for Key Reinstallation Attack. KRACK may be a severe replay attack\non Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol (WPA2), which secures your Wi-Fi connection. Hackers use KRACK\nto take advantage of a vulnerability in WPA2. When in close range of a possible victim, attackers can\naccess and skim encrypted data using KRACK.\nHow KRACK Works\nYour Wi-Fi client uses a four-way handshake when attempting to attach to a protected network. The\nhandshake confirms that both the client - your smartphone, laptop, et cetera - and therefore thIT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!\n127\n\ne access point share the right credentials, usually a password for the network. This establishes the\nPairwise passkey (PMK), which allows for encoding . Overall, this handshake procedure allows for\nquick logins and connections and sets up a replacement encryption key with each connection. this is\noften what keeps data secure on Wi-Fi connections, and every one protected Wi-Fi connections use\nthe four-way handshake for security. This protocol is that the reason users are encouraged to use\nprivate or credential-protected Wi-Fi instead of public connections. KRACK affects the third step of\nthe handshake, allowing the attacker to control and replay the WPA2 encryption key to trick it into\ninstalling a key already in use. When the key's reinstalled, other parameters related to it - the\nincremental transmit packet number called the nonce and therefore the replay counter - are set to\ntheir original values. Rather than move to the fourth step within the four-way handshake, nonce\nresets still replay transmissions of the third step. This sets up the encryption protocol for attack, and\ncounting on how the attackers replay the third-step transmissions, they will take down Wi-Fi security.\nWhy KRACK may be a Threat\nThink of all the devices you employ that believe Wi-Fi. it isn't almost laptops and smartphones;\nnumerous smart devices now structure the web of Things (IoT). due to the vulnerability in WPA2,\neverything connected to Wi-Fi is in danger of being hacked or hijacked. Attackers using KRACK can\ngain access to usernames and passwords also as data stored on devices. Hackers can read emails and\nconsider photos of transmitted data then use that information to blackmail users or sell it on the\nDark Web. Theft of stored data requires more steps, like an HTTP content injection to load malware\ninto the system. Hackers could conceivably take hold of any device used thereon Wi-Fi connection.\nBecause the attacks require hackers to be on the brink of the target, these internet security threats\ncould also cause physical security threats. On the opposite hand, the necessity to be in close\nproximity is that the only excellent news associated with KRACK, as meaning a widespread attack\nwould be extremely difficult. Victims are specifically targeted. However, there are concerns that a\nexperienced attacker could develop the talents to use HTTP content injection to load malware onto\nwebsites to make a more widespread affect.\nEveryone is in danger from KRACK vulnerability. Patches are available for Windows and iOS devices,\nbut a released patch for Android devices is currently in question (November 2017). There are issues\nwith the discharge , and lots of question if all versions and devices are covered. The real problem is\nwith routers and IoT devices. These devices aren't updated as regularly as computer operating\nsystems, and for several devices, security flaws got to be addressed on the manufacturing side. New\ndevices should address KRACK, but the devices you have already got in your home probably aren't\nprotected.\nThe best protection against KRACK is to make sure any device connected to Wi-Fi is patched and\nupdated with the newest firmware. that has checking together with your router's manufacturer\nperiodically to ascertain if patches are available.\nThe safest connection option may be a private VPN, especially when publicly spaces. If you would like\na VPN for private use, avoid free options, as they need their own security problems and there'll even\nbe issues with HTTPs. Use a paid service offered by a trusted vendor like Kaspersky. Also, more\nmodern networks use WPA3 for better security. Avoid using public Wi-Fi, albeit it's password\nprotection. That password is out there to almost anyone, which reduces the safety level considerably.\nAll the widespread implications of KRACK and therefore the WPA2 vulnerability aren't yet clear.\nwhat's certain is that everybody who uses Wi-Fi is in danger and wishes to require precautions to\nguard their data and devices."

A proxy server is essentially a computer on the web with its own IP address that your\ncomputer knows. once you send an internet request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The\nproxy server then makes your web request on your behalf, collects the response from the online\nserver, and forwards you the online page data so you'll see the page in your browser."
